# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open, welcoming, and inclusive environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone. This includes respecting individuals regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, sexual identity, or orientation.

We are committed to promoting accessibility, equity, and representation in all aspects of the project.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Respecting different viewpoints and experiences
- Providing constructive and respectful feedback
- Publicly recognizing the contributions of others
- Showing empathy and consideration for fellow community members
- Respecting personal boundaries, including preferred names and pronouns

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Offensive comments, personal or political attacks
- Harassment, whether public or private
- Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or sustained disruption of discussions
- Conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for defining and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior. They are expected to take fair and appropriate corrective action in response to instances of unacceptable conduct.

Project maintainers have the right to edit, remove, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct. They may also temporarily or permanently ban contributors who engage in harmful behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Representation includes using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at events.

Project maintainers may further define and clarify what constitutes representation of the project.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior can be reported by contacting the project team at [INSERT CONTACT INFORMATION]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The project team is committed to maintaining confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Project maintainers who fail to follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent consequences as determined by project leadership.

Details of specific enforcement policies may be published separately to ensure transparency and accountability.
